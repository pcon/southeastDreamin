<p>{{Name}},</p>
<p>Due to the recent outbreak and concern over COVID-19 the Southeast Dreamin' team has had to make the difficult decision to postpone this year's event.  We are now going to be holding the event August 20th and 21st at the same location.</p>

<p>We absolutely want you to still be a part of the event in August and your speaker slot is still being held.  Please be on the lookout for an email being sent to all attendees with more information about the new dates.</p>

<p>We look forward to seeing you in Atlanta in August!</p>
